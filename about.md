I'm a programmer and I work at [Wave][wave].

<!--
I've been working with Ruby on Rails since 2008.

In my spare time I may...
  - Write moooar code! I love open source, I've
    contributed to [Rails][rails-contribution], [Puma][puma-contributions] and
    I've written the [*dropbox_api* gem][dropbox-gem]. I've also been
    tinkering with machine learning lately by creating a toy app for
    [bib detection][instarun].
  - Practice some outdoor sports such as running, climbing or swimming. Weather
    is often nice and sunny in [Alicante, Spain][alicante].
  - Enjoy life with [Loreto][loreto].
