I'm a programmer and I work at [Visrez][visrez]. I've been working with Ruby
on Rails since 2008.

In my spare time I may...
  - Write moooar code! I love open source, I've
    [contributed to Rails][rails-contribution] and I've written the
    [*dropbox_api* gem][dropbox-gem]. I've also been tinkering with machine
    learning lately.
  - Practice some outdoor sports, weather is often nice and sunny in Alicante,
    Spain.
  - Enjoy life with [Loreto][loreto].
