Today I'm finishing my first week at RC. Yay!

I'm struggling to get used to this, which I guess means that I needed to go
through this experience.

The fact that I'm feeling overwhelmed I think means that I haven't been
challenged enough for the past years, feeling challenged is a crucial part of
the process to learn in my opinion so this has to be good.

Other recursers are doing great work and wonderful presentations. I'm lucky
to be surrounded by them for the next few months.

I'm currently researching the source code of [Puma][puma]. I've set myself the
goal to make a significant contribution to this project, on which I've never
contributed before. I'm having fun discovering its internals and also wondering
where this research is going to lead me to.

I keep reminding myself that even if I can't make good contributions to the
project the journey will be worth anyway just for the experience & the fun
of hacking.
