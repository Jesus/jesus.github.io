For the first time, I want to write about something totally non-technical. The
reason why I started writing this blog was because I wanted to become a better
programmer so I think a lot about how to achieve this. In particular, this'll
talk about self-development.

Have you noticed how we often become better at something when we overcome
a challenge? It's natural in life to face a difficulties, they put us in pain
for a while but in any of them we grab one or two lessons so we come out
stronger.

But what happens when your life is exempt of significant problems. Well, I
think then you should be worrying because you're getting unused to learn.
Sooner or later,
the problems are going to come and then you'll have to change but you may not
be prepared for it, you've been having a convenient life for too long. You're
suffering atrophy.

When things are going well we tend to relax. Maybe we worked hard in
the past and now we're collecting the fruits.

While I think resting is super important, resting too much isn't good. To avoid
the atrophy we should try to keep always challenging ourselves.

Being comfortable is a luxury that should be enjoyed, it's tempting to settle
there, but it's better to move on and keep pushing the boundaries of our
comfort zone.

And there're some lessons that you're going to have to learn anyway. You can
learn them the hard way, but learning during good times is better because:

  - You won't be in pressure so you're more likely to enjoy it.
  - You'll be less likely to face serious problems just because you're in
    better shape.

It's hard to push yourself when you don't really need to, and maybe some people
around you won't understand it. But it's actually a good thing.

Not only is better because your achievements will be more ambitious, but it's
also easier in the long term. Probably, it takes way more effort to achieve the
same goals when the situation is overwhelming.

<!-- I'd even go further and say that it's better to try to improve when you don't
need to. For different reasons:

  - You won't be in pressure so you're more likely to enjoy it.
  - You'll be less likely to face serious problems just because you're in better shape.

It's hard to push yourself when you don't really need to, and maybe some people
around you won't understand it. But it's actually a good thing.

I can only think of one way to solve that is to.

I'm not inventing anything new, you may have heard of *[kaizen][kaizen]*.

Put effort on improving during good times, because bad times will come.

Or.

Put effort on improving during good times, because then you're able to achieve
higher goals.

I'm sharing this in the hope that it'll help others. But also I'm
making myself a promise that I will keep challenging myself, in all facets of
life, always pushing harder.

Lastly, the best part about sharing an opinion is to open discussion so please
tell me what you think in the comments.
