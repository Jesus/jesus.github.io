Last week, my brother and I participated in [Google's
Hashcode][google-hashcode]. It's a programming contest with just two rounds:

 1. The first round is online, around 5000 teams try to solve an engineering
    problem in just 4 hours. Teamwork is crucial!
 2. The second and last round is held at Google's headquarters in Dublin.

Our results could have been better, [our solution][solution-code] ranked
1554<sup>th</sup> in the general
scoreboard and 64<sup>th</sup> in Spain's ranking. But the experience was
great.

None of us had ever participated in an event like this nor any hackathons.

The event was very well organized and [the problem][problem-statement] was
a huge brain teaser. I must say that it got me hooked for hours even after the
round was over. I woke up very early the next morning thinking about it!

We also spent some time afterwards discussing what things we could have done
better, at both technical and organizational levels. I think we can do a bit
better if we try again. And I'm looking forward to it.

It was great fun and hopefully we'll be able to repeat next year.

Thanks Javi!
