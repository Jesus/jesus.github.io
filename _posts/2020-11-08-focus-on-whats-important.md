At any point in your career as an engineer you might ask yourself you might
ask yourself what is the next step you need to take to become better. In
early stages it's likely that your technicals skills can improve a lot, later
on you may notice that your technical ability is no longer the most leveraged
aspect of your productivity: you can be more effective by understanding better
the problems you're solving, and you can even get further on that track by
understanding better what problems are worth solving.

<!-- Often, the path to growth involves widening the scope of your focus. -->

I heard somewhere that one way to become the 10x engineer is to find the way
to solve the problem you're facing with 10x less work. That's arguable, of
course, but it does hint something undeniable: it's really
important to understand your context in order to be effective.

Well, if you accept this branch of reasoning and take it even further, you may
not only ask if your solution is the best path to solve that problem, but also
if that problem is important enough to be worth your time. And at that point
a whole new dimension to think about the meaning of your work uncovers before
you.

Provide example:
An astonishing technical achievement, vs a technically trivial but
with very positive consequences. Ideas:
- pharmacist working on beauty vs a pharmacist investigating Covid.

<!-- A sensible reasoning is to think that anything well paid is well worth your
time, and that's a valid point I think. But ultimately if you just follow
money you're likely to be slaved by it. If you solve real problems I think
it'll become easy to be wealthy enough to live reasonably well, it'll
definitely flip the negotiation to your side. -->

And that, I think, is the most fundamental reason why I think that joining
Wave a little over a year ago has been the best move I could have ever
imagined to grow as an engineer. This is a company where we're
solving an important problem: financial infrastructure in Africa. I don't
think I could have found a more meaningful use of my time in this time period.

If you also think working on an important problem matters, definitely consider
applying to one of our [open positions][careers-wave]. We're now hiring new engineers to
support the huge growth we've been experiencing.

Or, you know, give some thought to what's the ultimate goal of the company
you work for and decide if it's worth your time or find a tech company that
works on something that you care about. Life is too short to waste it.

<!-- Aside from that, it's also been ideal because I've seen in first person how
a tech company can scale from a few employees to over a million monthly
active users which we just achieved a few weeks ago. -->
